# Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis

This project performs detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris dataset. It answers a series of statistical and visual questions based on the data, grouped by flower species.

## Key Objectives
- Compute summary statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.)
- Generate covariance and correlation matrices
- Visualize data with histograms by class
- Identify features most useful for species classification

## Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Highlights
- Found strong correlation between petal width and petal length
- Demonstrated species-wise variations in feature distributions
- Discussed hidden insights lost when class labels are ignored

## Dataset
[UCI Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
